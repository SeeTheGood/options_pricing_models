This repo contains options pricing models I've built while studying the Pricing Options with Mathematical Models course taught by Caltech Professor Jaksa Cvitanic.

Models Included:
- Black-Scholes model for European options
- Binomial tree model
- Implied volatility solver
- Risk Greeks visualization (Delta, Vega, Theta, Gamma)

Why I built this:
As someone with a passion for options trading I wanted to deepen my technical understanding of how options are pricedâ€”and how risk is quantified in real time. This project is my way of learning how options are being priced using different models.

Next steps:
- Extend to American options
- Add Monte Carlo simulation
- Explore backtesting with real data
